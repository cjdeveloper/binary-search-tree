This is a project in the visualization of a binary search tree.

The user can currently add nodes via an input field/button and remove nodes by clicking the node.
The nodes currently only accept numbers (ex. 35). 

Features that I'd like to implement:
<ul>
  <li>Animating the insertion and deletion process so that the user can understand how nodes are added 
      or removed from the tree</li>
  <li>A popover for each node that will display its contents</li>      
</ul>
